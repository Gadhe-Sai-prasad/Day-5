│ ├─ 📝 Check out/return (download)   │
│ ├─ 👥 Multiple people can access    │
│ ├─ 🗂️ Organized by categories       │
│ └─ 🔒 Safe storage (won't lose)     │
│                                     │
│ 💻 GitHub (Code Library)            │
│ ├─ 📄 Code files (HTML, CSS, JS)    │
│ ├─ ⬇️ Download/Upload (git commands) │
│ ├─ 👥 Team collaboration            │
│ ├─ 📁 Organized by projects         │

🎯 GitHub in 3 Simple Points


🎯 What GitHub Does:

1. 💾 STORES your code safely in the cloud
   - Like Google Drive but for programmers
   - Your code is safe even if computer breaks

2. 👥 SHARES your code with others
   - Send link to friend → they can see your code
   - Teams can work on same project

3. ⏰ TRACKS all changes you make
   - See what you changed yesterday
   - Go back to old version if needed
